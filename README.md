My entry into the 48-hour Ludum Dare game development competition. The theme was 'Minimalism' and my game is a one-button Gameboy-style platformer featuring 24 levels, multiple enemies and obstacles, and Super Meat Boy-style action replays.

This was made in Actionscript using the Flixel library with additional supporting code from Photonstorm's Flixel Power Tools and Axcho's FlxTilemapPlus
